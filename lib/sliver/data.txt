1. SliverAppBar: Used to create an app bar that can scroll, collapse, or stay pinned.
2. SliverList and SliverGrid:Used to create scrollable lists or grids of widgets.Not explicitly used in this code (a ListView is used instead), but they can replace ListView in custom CustomScrollView setups.
3. SliverPadding: Adds padding around sliver widgets.

SliverToBoxAdapter:
SliverList:

When to Use Each
SliverToBoxAdapter	For static content or custom widgets that don't need lazy loading or dynamic building.
SliverList
  1. For dynamic, scrollable lists of items where performance and lazy loading are priorities.
  2.Must be inside a CustomScrollView.
  3. Lazy Loading	Yes (via SliverChildBuilderDelegate).


Why Use SliverList in CustomScrollView?
Native Integration: SliverList is specifically designed to work within CustomScrollView alongside other slivers like SliverAppBar, SliverToBoxAdapter, etc. Using it ensures smooth integration and unified scrolling behavior.
Scroll Synchronization: When you use SliverList, all elements within the CustomScrollView share the same scroll physics, layout constraints, and behavior.

Why Avoid ListView.builder in CustomScrollView?
A ListView inside a CustomScrollView creates its own scrollable area. This can cause problems with scroll synchronization,
ListView.builder adds an extra layer of scrolling logic, which can be unnecessary if you are already using slivers.
To use ListView.builder in a CustomScrollView, you need to wrap it in a SliverToBoxAdapter. This adds complexity and defeats the purpose of having a native SliverList.


Nested ScrollView:
Explanation of headerSliverBuilder
In the provided example:

headerSliverBuilder is a callback function in NestedScrollView that builds the sliver(s) for the header section of the scroll view.
The SliverAppBar is created in the header, making the toolbar scrollable and responsive.
When the user scrolls, the FlexibleSpaceBar ensures that the content (like the image and title) reacts dynamically, e.g., shrinking or disappearing.

FlexibleSpaceBar
A typical use of FlexibleSpaceBar is to create a collapsible toolbar with a background image and a title that slides into view.

LayoutBuilder
The LayoutBuilder widget in Flutter is used to dynamically build widgets based on their
parentâ€™s constraints. This is particularly useful when you need a widget to adapt its
layout depending on the available space.
